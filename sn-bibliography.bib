	abstract = {The past 20 years have seen substantial work on the modeling of ductile damage and fracture. Several factors explain this interest. (i) There is a growing demand to provide tools which allow to increase the efficiency of structures (reduce weight, increase service temperature or load, etc.) while keeping or increasing safety. This goal is indeed first achieved by using better materials but also by improving design tools. Better tools have been provided which consist (ii) of material constitutive equations integrating a physically-based description of damage processes and (iii) of better numerical tools which allow to use the improved constitutive equations in structural computations which become more and more realistic. This article reviews the material constitutive equations and computational tools, which have been recently developed to simulate ductile rupture.},

	abstract = {The effects of void nucleation occurring during the deformation history on forming limit curves are considered for both in-plane and punch stretching employing a constitutive model of a porous plastic solid. Both plastic strain controlled and stress controlled nucleation processes are simulated by a two parameter void nucleation criterion. For in-plane stretching, plastic strain controlled nucleation can have, in certain circumstances, a significantly destabilizing effect on the forming limit curve. However, within the framework of plane stress theory which neglects the enhancement of the hydrostatic stress due to necking, a stress controlled nucleation process is not found to be significantly destabilizing. In punch stretching a ductile rupture criterion, which limits the maximum volume fraction of voids, as well as the appearance of a well defined thickness trough, is adopted as a localized necking criterion. Only plastic strain controlled void nucleation is considered here in out-of-plane stretching. The resulting forming limit curves have the same shape as those obtained previously with void nucleation neglected.},

	abstract = {Widely used constitutive laws for engineering materials assume plastic incompressibility, and no effect on yield of the hydrostatic component of stress. However, void nucleation and growth (and thus bulk dilatancy) are commonly observed is some processes which are characterized by large local plastic flow, such as ductile fracture. The purpose of this work is to develop approximate yield criteria and flow rules for porous (dilatant) ductile materials, showing the role of hydrostatic stress in plastic yield and void growth. Other elements of a constitutive theory for porous ductile materials, such as void nucleation, plastic flow and hardening behavior, and a criterion for ductile fracture will be discussed in Part II of this series. The yield criteria are approximated through an upper bound approach. Simplified physical models for ductile porous materials (aggregates of voids and ductile matrix) are employed, with the matrix material idealized as rigid-perfectly plastic and obeying the von Mises yield criterion. Velocity fields are developed for the matrix which conform to the macroscopic flow behavior of the bulk material. Using a distribution of macroscopic flow fields and working through a dissipation integral, upper bounds to the macroscopic stress fields required for yield are calculated. Their locus in stress space forms the yield locus. It is shown that normality holds for this yield locus, so a flow rule results. Approximate functional forms for the yield loci are developed.},

	shorttitle = {Damage nucleation in {DP}-steels},
	url = {http://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/745818},
	abstract = {Most of the advanced high strength steels possess multi-phase microstructures with an inherent mechanical phase contrast, where different damage mechanisms are activated under deformation. This thesis is concerned with analyzing the damage mechanisms induced in ferritic martensitic DP-steels under monotonic and cyclic deformation modes. SEM diffraction techniques were combined to statistically analyze those mechanisms, towards a better understanding of the role of grain and interphase boundaries with respect to strain localization and damage initiation in DP-steels. The utilized techniques included secondary electron (SE) imaging, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI). The results were confirmed through quasi in situ deformation experiments. It was shown that damage initiation is highly dependent on the distribution and morphology of the martensitic islands, and it was found that cracks inside of the martensite are remarkably restricted to the prior austenite grain boundaries. This sensitivity of the prior austenite grain boundaries (PAGbs) in lath martensite may be attributed to several aspects: (i)	High Mn enrichment. (ii)	Crystallographic incompatibility across the PAGb. (iii)	Tensile residual stresses within the martensitic laths neighboring the PAGb. The first aspect was assessed by atom probe tomography, while the second aspect was investigated using micro-mechanical cantilever bending experiments. Finally, micro-scale residual stresses were measured using the FIB-assisted ring-core milling technique. All three factors are suggested to assist the nucleation and growth of micro-cracks in martensite, particularly along the prior austenite grain boundaries. Heat treatment modifications were implemented in an attempt to optimize the DP-steel microstructure, making it more tolerant towards deformation. As the applied intercritical annealing temperature is increased, the Mn grain boundary enrichment and the residual stresses in martensite decrease, making the prior austenite grain boundaries more resistant to cracking.},

	abstract = {The effects of void nucleation occurring during the deformation history on forming limit curves are considered for both in-plane and punch stretching employing a constitutive model of a porous plastic solid. Both plastic strain controlled and stress controlled nucleation processes are simulated by a two parameter void nucleation criterion. For in-plane stretching, plastic strain controlled nucleation can have, in certain circumstances, a significantly destabilizing effect on the forming limit curve. However, within the framework of plane stress theory which neglects the enhancement of the hydrostatic stress due to necking, a stress controlled nucleation process is not found to be significantly destabilizing. In punch stretching a ductile rupture criterion, which limits the maximum volume fraction of voids, as well as the appearance of a well defined thickness trough, is adopted as a localized necking criterion. Only plastic strain controlled void nucleation is considered here in out-of-plane stretching. The resulting forming limit curves have the same shape as those obtained previously with void nucleation neglected.},

	abstract = {This contribution is devoted to the formulation and numerical implementation of a ductile damage constitutive model enriched with a thermodynamically consistent nonlocal theory of integral type. In order to describe ductile deformation, the model takes finite strains into account. To model elasticity, a Hencky-like hyperelastic free energy potential coupled with nonlocal damage is adopted. The thermodynamic consistency of the model is ensured by applying the first and second thermodynamical principles in the global form and the dissipation inequality can be re-written in a local form by incorporating a nonlocal residual that accounts for energy exchanges between material points of the nonlocal medium. The thermodynamically consistent nonlocal model is compared with its associated classical formulation (in which nonlocality is merely incorporated by averaging the damage variable without resorting to thermodynamic potentials) where the thermodynamical admissibility of the classical formulation is demonstrated. Within the computational scheme, the nonlocal constitutive initial boundary value problem is discretized over pseudo-time where it is shown that well established numerical integration strategies can be straightforwardly extended to the nonlocal integral formulation. A modified Newton-Raphson solution strategy is adopted to solve the nonlinear complementarity problem and its numerical implementation, regarding the proposed nonlocal constitutive model, is presented in detail. The results of two-dimensional finite element analyses show that the model is able to eliminate the pathological mesh dependence inherently present under the softening regime if the local theory is considered.},

	abstract = {A generalized finite-volume theory is proposed for two-dimensional elasticity problems on rectangular domains. The generalization is based on a higher-order displacement field representation within individual subvolumes of a discretized analysis domain, in contrast with the second-order expansion employed in our standard theory. The higher-order displacement field is expressed in terms of elasticity-based surface-averaged kinematic variables, which are subsequently related to corresponding static variables through a local stiffness matrix derived in closed form. The novel manner of defining the surface-averaged kinematic and static variables is a key feature of the generalized finite-volume theory, which provides opportunities for further exploration. Satisfaction of subvolume equilibrium equations in an integral sense, a defining feature of finite-volume theories, provides the required additional equations for the local stiffness matrix construction. The theory is constructed in a manner which enables systematic specialization through reductions to lower-order versions. Part I presents the theoretical framework. Comparison of predictions by the generalized theory with its predecessor, analytical and finite-element results in Part II illustrates substantial improvement in the satisfaction of interfacial continuity conditions at adjacent subvolume faces, producing smoother stress distributions and good interfacial conformability.},

            This paper deals with the implementation of an anisotropic plasticity constitutive equations exhibiting non-linear isotropic, kinematic hardening and coupled continuum ductile damage models. A fully implicit integration of the coupling constitutive equations is adopted and leads to two non-linear local scalar equations solved using the Newton method. The consistent local tangent modulus is obtained in a closed form by exact linearization of the algorithm. The numerical treatment of the proposed algorithm is implemented on ABAQUS using user interface material subroutines (UMAT and VUMAT). The performance of the present algorithm is assessed and bared out by numerical examples.},

	abstract = {This book presents novel methods for the simulation of damage evolution in aerospace composites that will assist in predicting damage onset and growth and thus foster less conservative designs which realize the promised economic benefits of composite materials. The presented integrated numerical/experimental methodologies are capable of taking into account the presence of damage and its evolution in composite structures from the early phases of the design (conceptual design) through to the detailed finite element method analysis and verification phase. The book is based on the GARTEUR Research Project AG-32, which ran from 2007 to 2012, and documents the main results of that project. In addition, the state of the art in European projects on damage evolution in composites is reviewed. While the high specific strength and stiffness of composite materials make them suitable for aerospace structures, their sensitivity to damage means that designing with composites is a challenging task. The new approaches described here will prove invaluable in meeting that challenge},

Patient-specific hip joint geometry is segmented directly from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging datasets and the resulting bone surfaces are processed into a form suitable for volume meshing. A high resolution continuum tetrahedral mesh has been generated, where a sandwich model approach is adopted; the bones are represented as a stiffer cortical shells surrounding more flexible cancellous cores. Cartilage is included as a uniform thickness extruded layer and the effect of layer thickness is investigated. To realistically position the bones, gait analysis has been performed giving the 3D positions of the bones for the full gait cycle. Three phases of the gait cycle are examined using a finite volume based custom structural contact solver implemented in open-source software OpenFOAM.},

According to the conventional terminology, the current numerical methods can be grouped in two major categories: partitioned methods and monolithic methods. Both methods use separate sets of equations for fluid and solid that have different unknown variables. A unified solution method has been presented in the previous work of Giannopapa and Papadakis (2004, “A New Formulation for Solids Suitable for a Unified Solution Method for Fluid-Structure Interaction Problems,” ASME PVP 2004, San Diego, CA, July, PVP Vol. 491–1, pp. 111–117), which is different from these methods. The new approach treats both fluid and solid as a single continuum; thus, the whole computational domain is treated as one entity discretized on a single grid. Its behavior is described by a single set of equations, which are solved fully implicitly. In this paper, the elastodynamic equations are reformulated so that they contain the same unknowns as the Navier–Stokes equations, namely, velocities and pressure. Two time marching and one spatial discretization scheme, widely used for fluid equations, are applied for the solution of the reformulated equations for solids. Using linear stability analysis, the accuracy and dissipation characteristics of the resulting difference equations are examined. The aforementioned schemes are applied to a transient structural problem (beam bending) and the results compare favorably with available analytic solutions and are consistent with the conclusions of the stability analysis. A parametric investigation using different meshes, time steps, and beam dimensions is also presented. For all cases examined, the numerical solution was stable and robust and therefore is suitable for the next stage of application to full fluid-structure-interaction problems.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a process condition diagram (PCD) that not only identifies conditions under which materials fracture during bar drawing, but also infers the presence or absence of microdefects such as microvoids and microcracks in the drawn material as accumulative damage changes owing to the die semi-angle and reduction ratio. The accumulative damage values were calculated by finite element (FE) analysis. The critical damage values were determined by performing a tensile test using a smooth round bar tensile specimen and performing FE analysis simulating the tensile test. High alloy steel with a 13 mm diameter was used for the draw bench testing in a wide range of drawing conditions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was performed to verify the usefulness of the PCD. SEM images showed that the accumulative damage roughly matched the size of microvoids around the non-metallic inclusions and the creation of microcracks, which eventually led to fractures of material being drawn. Hence, utilizing the proposed PCD, a process designer can design drawing conditions that minimize the occurrence of microdefects in the material being drawn while maximizing the reduction ratio.},

In this case, solutions have been proposed to represent the differences of behavior in tension and in compression also called quasi-unilateral (QU) conditions or microdefects closure effect.
            A recent anisotropic damage model has been developed to take into account the damage orthotropy induced by plasticity (Lemaitre, J., Demorat R. and Sauzay, M. (2000). Anisotropic Damage Law of Evolution, Eur. J. Mech. A/Solids, 19: 513—524). The purposes here are then two. First, a unified framework for isotropic and anisotropic damage is proposed. Then, it is to extend Ladevèze and Lemaitre's framework (Ladevèze, P. and Lemaitre, J. (1984). Damage Effective Stress in Quasi Unilateral Conditions, In: Proceedings of the 16th International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, Lyngby, Denmark) for the QU conditions to anisotropic damage induced by plasticity.
            Yield surfaces and damage versus accumulated plastic strain curves, drawn for different loading, illustrate the effect of the QU conditions on the damage evolution.},

The material damage experienced in the wire after passing through the die is evaluated using the well-known Rice and Tracey, Cockcroft and Latham, Brozzo and Modified Chaouadi models. Due to the fact that nonrealistic damage predictions are found for the highest studied wire reduction, an alternative uncoupled failure criterion combining the effect of deformation and triaxility is proposed. The ability of these five models in predicting the formation of chevrons in the process is the main focus of this research. First, the model parameters are characterized by means of numerical simulations of the tensile test. Then, the predictions of the numerical analyses of the drawing process are compared with available experimental results where physical evidence of chevrons was found. Relevant variables are analyzed to determine their incidence in the formation of central bursts. Finally, the performance of this new model is assessed for the full reduction scenarios.},

This allows determination of the evolution of strain-stress fields until fracture occurs.

	abstract = {Micro-scaled plastic deformation, viz., microforming, has been widely used to fabricate microparts with at least two dimensions in submillimeter. In microforming, ductile fracture significantly affects product quality and the forming limit of materials. It happens when the deformation method, mode and sequence are not reasonable. Although extensive research on ductile fracture and ductile fracture criteria in macroforming domain has been conducted, the applicability of these criteria in microforming scenario has not yet been extensively explored and studied. It is thus necessary to explore and address this issue to support the design of microforming process and quality control of the microformed parts. In this paper, the applicability of the uncoupled ductile fracture criteria’s in microforming is investigated and discussed. The hybrid constitutive model developed in prior research is used to study the applicability of ductile fracture criteria in microforming via finite element simulation and physical experiments. The simulation results of each criterion are compared with the upsetting experiment to determine the most suitable criterion for further experimental implementation in flanged upsetting and extrusion processes. The influence of size-effects on the applicability of the uncoupled ductile fracture criteria is explored and the stress-induced fracture map is used to demonstrate this effect. The applicability of ductile fracture criteria in microforming is extensively revealed and analyzed and the research thus provides an in-depth understanding of the applicability of ductile fracture criteria in microforming processes.},

	abstract = {In this contribution, a modification and application of the Lemaitre damage evolution law is proposed for the problem of fatigue life estimate under low number of cycles. For this, the denominator of damage, considered constant for Lemaitre, was replaced by a function dependent on the stress triaxiality. The new function has a nonlinear and thermodynamically consistent behavior. In addition, the evolution law of the backstress tensor is adopted as proposed by Desmorat, where there is no saturation of the limit value. The formulation is implemented in an academic tool for analysis at one Gauss point, through an implicit integration strategy of the flow equations. The Newton-Raphson method is used to solve a system of nonlinear equations, with two tensor and two scalar equations. Thus, in order to demonstrate the robustness of the model, experimental data from the literature for SAE 1045 and S460N steels are adopted. Proportional and nonproportional axial, torsional and multiaxial loading paths are simulated. Finally, the results have shown that the modification formulation is a good strategy to control the damage evolution in predicting fatigue life. In this sense, the calculated lives by the new proposal are within a scatter band of factor three, both under normal or torsional uniaxial loading conditions, as well as proportional or nonproportional multiaxial conditions.},

	shorttitle = {Damage nucleation in {DP}-steels},
	url = {http://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/745818},
	abstract = {Most of the advanced high strength steels possess multi-phase microstructures with an inherent mechanical phase contrast, where different damage mechanisms are activated under deformation. This thesis is concerned with analyzing the damage mechanisms induced in ferritic martensitic DP-steels under monotonic and cyclic deformation modes. SEM diffraction techniques were combined to statistically analyze those mechanisms, towards a better understanding of the role of grain and interphase boundaries with respect to strain localization and damage initiation in DP-steels. The utilized techniques included secondary electron (SE) imaging, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI). The results were confirmed through quasi in situ deformation experiments. It was shown that damage initiation is highly dependent on the distribution and morphology of the martensitic islands, and it was found that cracks inside of the martensite are remarkably restricted to the prior austenite grain boundaries. This sensitivity of the prior austenite grain boundaries (PAGbs) in lath martensite may be attributed to several aspects: (i)	High Mn enrichment. (ii)	Crystallographic incompatibility across the PAGb. (iii)	Tensile residual stresses within the martensitic laths neighboring the PAGb. The first aspect was assessed by atom probe tomography, while the second aspect was investigated using micro-mechanical cantilever bending experiments. Finally, micro-scale residual stresses were measured using the FIB-assisted ring-core milling technique. All three factors are suggested to assist the nucleation and growth of micro-cracks in martensite, particularly along the prior austenite grain boundaries. Heat treatment modifications were implemented in an attempt to optimize the DP-steel microstructure, making it more tolerant towards deformation. As the applied intercritical annealing temperature is increased, the Mn grain boundary enrichment and the residual stresses in martensite decrease, making the prior austenite grain boundaries more resistant to cracking.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the conditions for the occurrence of diffuse and localized necking in thin sheet metals are investigated. The prediction of these necking phenomena is undertaken using an elastic–plastic model coupled with ductile damage, which is then combined with various plastic instability criteria based on bifurcation theory. The bifurcation criteria are first formulated within a general three-dimensional modeling framework, and then specialized to the particular case of plane-stress conditions. Some theoretical relationships or links between the different investigated bifurcation criteria are established, which allows a hierarchical classification in terms of their conservative character in predicting critical necking strains. The resulting numerical tool is implemented into the finite element code ABAQUS/Standard to predict forming limit diagrams, in both situations of a fully three-dimensional formulation and a plane-stress framework. The proposed approach is then applied to the prediction of diffuse and localized necking for a DC06 mild steel material. The predicted forming limit diagrams confirm the above-established theoretical classification, revealing that the general bifurcation criterion provides a lower bound for diffuse necking prediction, while the loss of ellipticity criterion represents an upper bound for localized necking prediction. Some numerical aspects related to the prestrain effect on the development of necking are also investigated, which demonstrates the capability of the present approach in capturing the strain-path changes commonly encountered in complex sheet metal forming operations.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            A finite volume-based arbitrary fracture propagation model is used to simulate fracture growth and geomechanical stresses during hydraulic fracture treatments. Single-phase flow, poroelastic displacement, and in-situ stress tensor equations are coupled within a poroelastic reservoir domain, using a fixed-strain split assumption. The domain is idealized as two-dimensional and plane-strain, with heterogeneous elastic material and fracture toughness properties. Fracture propagation proceeds by failure along finite volume cells in excess of a threshold effective stress. The cohesive zone model (CZM) is used to simulate propagation of non-planar fractures in heterogeneous porous media under uniform, anisotropic stresses. In addition the model computes the stress field and the pore pressure in the rock matrix to account for stress interference effects. This allows us to estimate the simulated micro-seismic signature of the rock during fracturing. Results show that the presence of bedding planes or planes of weakness in the rock can lead to complex fracture trajectories. The growth of multiple, non-intersecting, competing fractures is also simulated. It is shown that the fracture geometry obtained using this model is highly dependent on the pattern of heterogeneity. For homogeneous reservoirs and a high in-situ stress contrast, planar fractures are obtained. As the stress contrast is decreased and the degree of heterogeneity is increased, fracture complexity increases. Results for different kinds and levels of formation heterogeneity; planes-of-weakness such as bedding planes or natural fracture networks, and layers with different mechanical properties are presented. This model allows for first-of-kind simulation of fracture propagation with arbitrary geometry in a poroelastic solid domain, using proven computational finite volume methods (FVM). The effect of fluid backpressure, mechanical stress shadow effects, and formation heterogeneity are accounted for. The importance of critical stresses on fracture path is discussed.},

	abstract = {A face-centred finite volume (FCFV) method is proposed for the linear elasticity equation. The FCFV is a mixed hybrid formulation, featuring a system of first-order equations, that defines the unknowns on the faces (edges in two dimensions) of the mesh elements. The symmetry of the stress tensor is strongly enforced using the well-known Voigt notation and the displacement and stress fields inside each cell are obtained element-wise by means of explicit formulas. The resulting FCFV method is robust and locking-free in the nearly incompressible limit. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions show optimal convergence of the displacement and the stress fields without any reconstruction. Moreover, the accuracy of the FCFV method is not sensitive to mesh distortion and stretching. Classical benchmark tests including Kirch's plate and Cook's membrane problems in two dimensions as well as three dimensional problems involving shear phenomenons, pressurised thin shells and complex geometries are presented to show the capability and potential of the proposed methodology.},

	abstract = {We present a new Lagrangian cell-centered scheme for two-dimensional compressible flows. The primary variables in this new scheme are cell-centered, i.e., density, momentum, and total energy are defined by their mean values in the cells. The vertex velocities and the numerical fluxes through the cell interfaces are not computed independently, contrary to standard approaches, but are evaluated in a consistent manner due to an original solver located at the nodes. The main new feature of the algorithm is the introduction of four pressures on each edge, two for each node on each side of the edge. This extra degree of freedom allows us to construct a nodal solver which fulfills two properties. First, the conservation of momentum and total energy is ensured. Second, a semidiscrete entropy inequality is provided. In the case of a one-dimensional flow, the solver reduces to the classical Godunov acoustic solver: it can be considered as its two-dimensional generalization. Many numerical tests are presented. They are representative test cases for compressible flows and demonstrate the robustness and the accuracy of this new solver.},
